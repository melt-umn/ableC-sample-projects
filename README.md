# ableC_sample_projects

Sample ableC projects demonstrating how to compose independently-developed language extensions.

### Installation
The scripts for building the extended ableC compilers in these sample
projects assumes that this repository is cloned into the same
directory into which ableC is placed.  This directory contains both
the `ableC` directory (the repository at http://github.com/melt-umn/ableC)
and the `ableC_sample_projects` directory that is this repository.
